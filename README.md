# Program-task
This is a project I did for an application program.

I was given two weeks of August to analyse several datasets for French Populations & Economics Indexes. I started this project from scratch; I knew nothing about timeseries nor forecasting. I'm aware that my work is not perfect and can be improved, but I think is interesting to see the results after just two weeks of work and research. 

However, I would love to get some feedback so I can consider those tips for future projects.
